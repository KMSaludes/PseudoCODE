First you have to convert the netmask or the slash into their binary form and then also convert the IP address to binary form
followed by adding up or doing the Bitwise OR to the mask and IP address binary form to get the subnet binary form.
Then eventually convert the binary mask, IP address and Subnet to decimal form.
So to get the Minimum IP you have to add 1 to the subnet then
to get the maximum IP you have to change all the zeroes of the binary form of the subnet into 1 then minus 1 .
